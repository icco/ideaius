      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>
      The whole goal of Stackius (which seriously needs a better name...) is to create a project management tool for &quot;Casual Mother-Fuckers&quot;.
      </p>

      <p>
      What does that even mean? Well, in the project management world, it seems to us here at DevCloud that everything is either aimed at businesses that &quot;Have Their Shit Together&quot; or individuals. You though, you're casual. So casual, that you just chill on the couch, hanging with your girls and guys, spitting ideas left and right. And you think, damn, I should write this shit down, so you do. And then you forget about it, until you have another conversation, which brings you back to your original idea. You forget some of the good parts of your idea, and write down some more on another napkin, which you lose. You then repeat this, forever, casually.
      </p>

      <p>
      But that's cool! We are here to help. We're providing a mobile and web interface for you and your friends to collaborate together, and write this shit down, so next time you're feeling productive, you can call upon a huge repository of thoughts from when you were kicking it casually. Because we want to let you stay casual, and still help the world (whether it's through making fart apps or curing cancer).
      </p>

      <p>
      We're not available to the general public yet, but we will be. And then, we can be casual as fuck together.

        <p>The end is never the end. A new challenge awaits. A test no man could be prepared for. A new hell he must conquer and destroy. A new level of growth he must confront himself. The machine in the ghost within. This is the journey of the man on the moon.</p>
