David Heinemeier Hansson (37 Signals, Founder)

- 1) Great Application 2) Price 3) Profit!
- Charge However You need. But if you get your users to pay for a service, you profit!
- But even if you put a price on it, no guarantee win
- You are not 50 Cent.
- 1:10 chance for making a mill, 1:10,000 for making a bill
- ~2,000 customers, $40 a month, 12 months = 1 Mill
- Finding Customers:
	- Aiming at consumers = HARD
	- Companies, a little easier
	- (Thought, Ideaius per company?)

- Lifestyle Buisness
	- Craigslist
	- Running at your own pace
	- Calling own shots

- Don't aim to high, your goal isn't to sellout, but to produce quality software.

- 37 Signals, Devoloped by 3 people in their free time
- 1 year, 1 server.

- Take it easy (there's never gonna be less work)
- Blame 37Signals if you die when you charge money.
- Solve your own problem, don't solve VC problems
