<p>		Good ideas die everyday. Our web application, Ideaius, is the solution to this problem 
and it could prevent this creative tragedy from happening everyday. In fact, as our slogan 
promises, Ideaius is the place “where good ideas come to live.” So instead of dying as scribbles 
on scrap paper or forgotten in the clutter of one’s mind, good ideas could be stored, shared, 
   expanded upon, and ultimately, brought to life.</p> <p>How? Our software empowers people to work on 
   their ideas by either submitting their own idea or collaborating and contributing to the 
   development of others’ ideas in a free and open-source environment The intimidating leap 
   between the origin of a good idea and the end of the traditional patent process discourages 
   many innovators from liberating their ideas.</p><p> Our site is dedicated to bringing forth 
   these ideas from the shadows, allowing anyone to easily submit and save their most 
   basic or most complex ideas through multiple forms of communication and to develop them 
   when they have the time. Through privacy settings, users can choose to share their ideas 
   with the public or with selected individuals, and may solicit help from individuals with 
   specific knowledge or skill sets. Users can also classify their idea with multiple tags so that others 
   may search and find congruent ideas or just interesting ideas that are descriptive of a project they want to help develop.</p>
