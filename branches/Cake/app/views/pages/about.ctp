<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>Good ideas die everyday. Our web application, Ideaius, is the solution to this problem and it could prevent this creative tragedy from happening everyday. In fact, as our slogan promises, Ideaius is the place “where good ideas come to live.” So instead of dying as scribbles on scrap paper or forgotten in the clutter of one’s mind, good ideas could be stored, shared, expanded upon, and ultimately, brought to life.</p>
<p>How? Our software empowers people to work on their ideas by either submitting their own idea or collaborating and contributing to the development of others’ ideas in a free and open-source environment The intimidating leap between the origin of a good idea and the end of the traditional patent process discourages many innovators from liberating their ideas.</p>
<p>Our site is dedicated to bringing forth these ideas from the shadows, allowing anyone to easily submit and save their most basic or most complex ideas through multiple forms of communication and to develop them when they have the time. Through privacy settings, users can choose to share their ideas with the public or with selected individuals, and may solicit help from individuals with specific knowledge or skill sets. Users can also classify their idea with multiple tags so that others may search and find congruent ideas or just interesting ideas that are descriptive of a project they want to help develop.</p>

at the height of amazingness, so if you see something wrong send us an email, help at ideaius dot com.</p>
