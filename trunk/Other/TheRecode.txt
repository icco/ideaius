So we (we being me) need to recode the site from mostly scratch.

The main important things

 - Security
 - Content
 - Users

"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"Holy Shit. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. There's a swordfish flying at my face?" 

 - Security
 	- Linux based? You, Your Group, Everyone else.

 - Use Classes.
 - A decent design.
 - Talk to Dan.
 - Get on web soon.

(Note: Mac laptop need an end key.)
